## Installation
Clone the repository
``` git clone https://github.com/n43ee7/Jetson-Afterburners.git ```

The current release of this script does not have a menu however I plan to release one quite soon thus further instructions will be updated soon. :)

Note: 
This script is tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano and is probable to run similarly on other Jetson modules.
